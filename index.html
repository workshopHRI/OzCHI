<h1>Call for participation</h1>
<p>The empowerment of humans in human-robot collaboration (HRC) is a focal issue for HRC research and development. Unpacking this requires a multifaceted approach with contributions from diverse disciplines. This workshop brings researchers and practitioners together to discuss when HRC empowers humans and when it does not, how the empowerment of human in HRC can be facilitated, the benefits of empowering humans in HRC, and who is empowered in HRC and who is not. We invite researchers and practitioners who actively work with or wish to expand their knowledge and experience in HRC to take part in this timely discussion.
</p>
<p>
The workshop will bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners from various disciplines, including Human- Computer Interaction, Robotics, Engineering, Design and Architecture, Ethics, Psychology, Social Sciences, and Artificial Intelligence whose work provides answers to the following questions: 
</p>

<li>Why are we creating platforms for human-robot collaboration, and what are the benefits for people? </li>
<li>When does design and development of HRC empower people, and when does it not? </li>
<li>How can the empowerment of people in HRC be facilitated through design and development? </li>
<li>Who is empowered by HRC, and who is not? </li>

<p>We invite participants to submit their contribution to these questions in one of three formats by 3. October, 2023. Submissions can be made through the OzCHI template on Easy Chair, accessible at https://workshophri.github.io/OzCHI2023/. Participants can submit in one of the three following formats: 
</p>
<li>A 1-page Expression of Interest (EOI) that outlines the participantâ€™s interest in HRC and a brief statement outlining how their work addresses one or more of the above questions. 
  </li>
<li>A 1-5 page position paper that focuses on a specific HRC topic or challenge, followed by a statement on how it addresses one or more of the above questions. The position paper may include one or more authors. 
  </li>
<li>A video submission that provides an engaging visual narrative or application for HRC with relevance to one or more of the above questions. Maximum video length is 3 minutes, submitted as either AVI or MPEG4 format. 
  </li>
<p>Additionally, all participants must submit a professional biography of maximum 150 words to help foster connections among attendees and mutual learning throughout the workshop. At least one author from each accepted submission, whether EOI, position paper, or video, must register for the conference and attend the workshop. We will publicly publish selected EOIs, position papers, and videos on the workshop website.
