<h1>Call for participation</h1>
<p>The empowerment of humans in human-robot collaboration (HRC) is a focal issue for HRC research and development. Unpacking this requires a multifaceted approach with contributions from diverse disciplines. This workshop brings researchers and practitioners together to discuss when HRC empowers humans and when it does not, how the empowerment of human in HRC can be facilitated, the benefits of empowering humans in HRC, and who is empowered in HRC and who is not. We invite researchers and practitioners who actively work with or wish to expand their knowledge and experience in HRC to take part in this timely discussion.
</p>
<p>
The workshop will bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners from various disciplines, including Human- Computer Interaction, Robotics, Engineering, Design and Architecture, Ethics, Psychology, Social Sciences, and Artificial Intelligence whose work provides answers to the following questions: 
</p>

<li>Why are we creating platforms for human-robot collaboration, and what are the benefits for people? </li>
<li>When does design and development of HRC empower people, and when does it not? </li>
<li>How can the empowerment of people in HRC be facilitated through design and development? </li>
<li>Who is empowered by HRC, and who is not? </li>


<p>We invite participants to submit their contribution to these questions in one of three formats by 3 October, 2023. Participants can submit in one of the three following formats: 
  a 1-page Expression of Interest (EOI), or a 1-5 page position paper or a video. Additionally, all participants must submit a professional biography of maximum 150 words to help foster connections among attendees and mutual learning throughout the workshop. 
  At least one author from each accepted submission, whether EOI, position paper, or video, must register for the conference and attend the workshop. 
  We will publicly publish selected EOIs, position papers, and videos on the workshop website. For any questions or inquiries, please direct any questions to:
